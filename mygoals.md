# 🎯 VOIDPACKET: Technical & Career Objectives (2025-2026)
This document outlines the actionable path from researcher to professional, focused on building proof and securing a role.

## 🚀 Overarching Mission
Transition from a self-taught researcher to a employed web application security professional by Q3 2026, using a public portfolio of projects and validated skills as the primary vehicle.

## 📅 Quarterly Roadmap
### Q4 2025 - Q1 2026: The Foundation Sprint (Current Focus)
- ✅ PWPA Certification: Obtain the Practical Web Application Penetrator certification.
- ✅ VOIDLOCK (Backend MVP): Build and deploy a functional Node.js/Express backend for the VOIDLOCK fitness app, implementing core APIs (user auth, workout log, penalty system).
- ✅ Web Galaxies Structure: Finalize the Galaxies (conceptual) and Cosmic Phenomena (exploit) structure for the VOIDPACKET-WEB-GALAXIES repo. Populate with completed guides.
- ✅ Advanced Contributions: Submit at least 2 high-quality vulnerability reports or write-ups to the BugForge platform.

### Q2 2026: The "Build to Break" Phase
- VOIDLOCK Security Audit: Conduct a full penetration test on your own VOIDLOCK application. Document the process, findings, and remediations in a public case study.
- Backend Course Completion: Finish the comprehensive back-end development course, with all key concepts demonstrated within the VOIDLOCK codebase.
- Portfolio Polish: Ensure the VOIDLOCK and VOIDPACKET-WEB-GALAXIES repositories are professional, well-documented, and highlighted on your personal website/portfolio.

### Q3 2026: The Job Sprint
- Entry-Level Web Pentester Role: Secure a position as a Junior Web Application Penetration Tester or Security Analyst.
- Continued Contribution: Maintain active participation and contribution within the BugForge/security research community.

## ⚙️ Core Projects & Assets
These are the tangible outputs that will demonstrate capability.
- VOIDLOCK Application:
	1. Purpose: The flagship project proving full-stack development skill and a "build to break" security mindset.
	2. Success Metrics: Functional deployed app, clean codebase, and a published security audit of it.

- VOIDPACKET-WEB-GALAXIES:
	1. Purpose: A structured public knowledge base that demonstrates deep, conceptual understanding of vulnerabilities and secure coding.
	2. Success Metrics: Clear "Galaxy" and "Phenomena" hierarchy with multiple complete, detailed guides.

- Professional Certification & Validation:
	1. Purpose: External, industry-recognized validation of practical skills.
	2. Success Metrics: PWPA certification, maintained public profiles (GitHub, BugForge) showcasing activity.

## 📈 Success Metrics
Progress is measured by shipping, not just studying.
1. PWPA exam passed.
2. VOIDLOCK backend deployed publicly (e.g., on Railway/Render).
3. 5+ complete guides in the VOIDPACKET-WEB-GALAXIES repo.
4. 10+ resolved reports or meaningful contributions on BugForge.
5. First technical interview for a web pentester role.
