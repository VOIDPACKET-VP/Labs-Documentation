# Lab: Input brute-force/fuzzing due to server's response behavior

## Lab description 
History has failed us, but no matter. Server source There are two flags in this challenge. Submit flag one here, and flag two in Pachinko Revisited.

	1. Opening the website.
	2. Submitting the circuit ( i didn't change anything)
	3. The flag got revealed in an alert box
