# Challenge : Divisible and Non-divisible Sums Difference
- Topic : MATH
- Level : EASY

## Description :
```
You are given positive integers n and m.

Define two integers as follows:

num1: The sum of all integers in the range [1, n] (both inclusive) that are not divisible by m.
num2: The sum of all integers in the range [1, n] (both inclusive) that are divisible by m.
Return the integer num1 - num2.
```

## Solution :
- Python3 :
```
class Solution:
    def differenceOfSums(self, n: int, m: int) -> int:
        d_div_num = []
        nd_div_num = []

        for i in range(n+1):
            if i % m != 0:
                nd_div_num.append(int(i))
            if i % m == 0:
                d_div_num.append(int(i))
            
        num1 = sum(nd_div_num)
        num2 = sum(d_div_num)
        return num1 - num2
